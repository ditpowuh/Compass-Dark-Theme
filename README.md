# Compass Dark Theme (By Ditpowuh)

### Installation / Instructions

**How to install:**
1. Check if your browser is compatible. You can simply do this by checking if you are able to install extensions. If you are unable to install extensions, extensions are blocked and thus, you are unable to install **Compass Dark Theme**. You may attempt to use another browser.
2. Install some sort of CSS overlay editor. I would reccomend **Stylus** for those who are using **Chrome**, **Firefox** or **Chronium**. 
3. After installation, click on it at the toolbar and click on "Manage" (a page should open up).
4. Click on "Write new style" and paste in the desired code (the version of Compass Dark Theme you want). No errors should appear.
5. Press the the "+" near the bottom of the page and change the option to "URLs starting with".
6. Paste in the Compass website (for an example, https://a-certain-school.compass.education).
7. Give a name to the supposed file and press "Save".
8. If all steps are done correctly, it **should** work. Make sure it is enabled with the tickbox if it is not working.
